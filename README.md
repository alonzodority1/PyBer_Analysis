# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
After a successful presentation V. Isualize has asked me to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and set up a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Below is the report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer:

## Results

### Ride and Fare Distrubtion
The numbers displayed in the pyber_summary_df shows an inverse relationship between total rides and drivers versues average fare per driver, while Average Fare Per Ride remains much mor constant.  You can see in the line graphs (analysis/Pyber_fare_summary_Object_Method.png) that while the volume of fares between city types reflects the same magnitude of differences than the summary it also shows there is a high seasonal correlation, meaning that, in general, when fares decrease in one city type, they decrease in the other 2 as well.   

## Summary

The clearest observation is that urban areas provide have the highest demand for pyber and provide the by far largest source of revunue, however on thing to investigate is the high average fare per driver in rural areas.  This does not seem to be a result of longer distances per ride as the varitation in Average Fare per Ride is dramatically less than inAverage Fare per Driver .  I would suggest more effort in recruiting more drivers in rural and suburban areas to increase total rides in both catagories.
